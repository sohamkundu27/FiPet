# FiPet Landing Screen

## Overview
The landing screen is the first screen users see when they open the FiPet app. It features an animated fox mascot and provides clear call-to-action buttons for new and existing users.

## Features

### ü¶ä Animated Fox Mascot
- **Eye Animation**: The fox's eyes wander randomly, creating a lifelike effect
- **Tail Wagging**: The tail wags back and forth continuously
- **Bouncing Animation**: The entire fox gently bounces up and down
- **Custom Styling**: Built using React Native Views with custom styling and shadows

### üìù Company Motto
- **Primary Tagline**: "Budget better. Think smarter."
- **Secondary Tagline**: "Raise your digital sidekick."
- **Typography**: Uses the SpaceMono font family for consistency
- **Styling**: Centered text with appropriate sizing and color hierarchy

### üéØ Call-to-Action Buttons
- **Primary Button**: "Get Started" - Prominent purple button for new users
- **Secondary Button**: "I Already Have an Account" - Outlined button for existing users
- **Navigation**: Both buttons navigate to the login screen

## Technical Implementation
